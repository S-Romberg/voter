# Ballot App

## Project Description
 Our ballot app is a web application that connects users with their congressional candidates. The goal of the application is to make the voting process easier and more accessible by giving users the information they need to make smart choices about who to vote for in upcoming elections. By helping voters get the information they need we can raise the voter turnout percentage.

### The Problem
 Only 58% of eligible voters participated in the 2016 presidential elections. In the 2014 mid-term elections, voter turnout was the lowest it has been in 70 years, just 36.4%. When it comes to local elections, the data is worse. Voter participation in local elections for many U.S. cities is now below 20%. 

### The Solution
 By giving voters an easy, digestable source of information they can learn about the important people playing a role in their local government. Informing voters about candidates before they enter a voting booth leads to not only informed and confident voters (and more of them) but also more effective public servants.

### UX
 When opening the app for the first time, the user is greeted on a landing page.
 The user can then create an account to build a 'personal ballot', or just browse candidate information.
 Once ready to browse information, users can filter by political party, government position, or by stance on hot topic issues
 Each candidate has a personal card including photo, political party, top platforms and link to personal site to learn more.
 Users have the option to save candidates to their 'personal ballot' to remember favorite candidates until election day.

### Data Exchange
